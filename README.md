# Torito: Cross-Border Lending Protocol

![Torito Logo](public/IMG_9244.jpeg)

## Overview

Torito is a decentralized lending protocol enabling users to deposit USDT and borrow up to 50% of its value in local FIAT currency at competitive exchange rates. Built on Optimism and LISK for speed and affordability, Torito leverages Morpho vaults for protocol profitability and to fund strategic OTC alliances, who pay FIAT directly to users' bank accounts.

## Features

- **Connect Wallet:** Securely connect your EVM wallet to manage deposits and loans.
- **Deposit USDT:** Instantly deposit USDT; funds are managed by Torito for protocol yield and OTC payouts.
- **Lending Visualization:** Real-time calculation of borrowable FIAT based on current exchange rates.
- **Borrow FIAT:** Access up to 50% of your USDT deposit in local currency, with dynamic interest rates. FIAT is paid out by OTC partners directly to your bank account.
- **Repay & Liquidate:** Repay loans with interest; collateral is liquidated if health factor drops. Users are notified when their loan repayments are received and processed.
- **Admin Controls:** Protocol owner can manage supported tokens, currencies, and oracles.

## How It Works

1. **Deposit USDT:** Users deposit USDT, which is managed by Torito for yield and OTC liquidity.
2. **Borrow FIAT:** Users borrow FIAT against their USDT collateral, up to 50% of its value. FIAT is paid out by OTC partners to users' bank accounts.
3. **Interest & Repayment:** Loans accrue interest; users repay to unlock collateral. Users are notified when repayments are received.
4. **Liquidation:** If collateral value falls, loans are liquidated to protect the protocol.

## Smart Contracts
